**Project Overview**

This project is a web-based fitness coaching application powered by Generative AI, developed using the Gemini API and Streamlit. The system delivers customized training programs, injury-aware recovery workouts, tactical coaching insights, and nutrition recommendations by analyzing an athlete’s sport, playing role, injury background, and fitness objectives. The goal is to provide young athletes with safe and structured coaching support, especially for those who do not have access to professional trainers.

**Problem Statement**

A large number of young athletes train without professional guidance, personalized workout plans, or proper recovery support. This often results in inefficient training methods, limited performance growth, and a higher risk of injury. By leveraging Generative AI, this project addresses these challenges by producing adaptive, individualized, and safety-focused fitness recommendations tailored to each athlete’s specific needs.

**Objectives**

* Design and implement an AI-driven fitness coaching web application
* Create personalized workout routines and recovery plans
* Ensure training recommendations prioritize injury safety
* Provide tactical coaching tips and nutrition guidance
* Deploy the application using Streamlit integrated with the Gemini API

**Research Summary**

The project involved research into sport-specific training principles, injury prevention strategies, recovery-focused workouts, and AI-based fitness recommendation systems. Existing studies on the use of artificial intelligence in sports coaching helped guide the system’s design. The final solution focuses on delivering personalized, adaptive, and safe training outputs suitable for young athletes.

**Model Configuration**

* The Gemini model was fine-tuned using different temperature values depending on the type of response required:
* A lower temperature setting (0.3) was used to generate structured, consistent, and safety-oriented workout and recovery plans.
* A higher temperature setting (0.7) was applied to produce more creative outputs such as tactical insights and nutrition suggestions.
* Prompt design and wording were continuously refined through testing to improve accuracy and personalization.

**Sample Outputs and Validation**

The system was evaluated using multiple test cases across different sports, positions, and injury scenarios. Outputs were reviewed for safety, relevance, and personalization. Recovery-related prompts produced appropriate training modifications, while workout plans aligned well with sport-specific demands. Further adjustments to prompt structure and model parameters enhanced output clarity and effectiveness.

**Features of the Web App**
* Input fields for sport, position, injury history, and training goals
* AI-generated personalized fitness and recovery plans
* Injury-conscious training recommendations
* Tactical performance improvement guidance
* Nutrition and hydration advice
* Clean and easy-to-use user interface

**Deployment**

The application was built using Streamlit and connected to the Gemini API to generate AI-driven responses. The complete project was hosted on GitHub and deployed on Streamlit Cloud, allowing public access to the web application.
